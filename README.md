# Hello! I'm Henrique Nas (but just Nas, please) 

Feel free to ask me about **Flutter** and **Coffee**. </br>
Currently, I'm working towards becoming a full-time open source engineer and occasionally contributing some unconventional PRs.

- Creator of [Wed](https://github.com/henriquenas/wed) (SPA for web Dart) framework
- Initiator of [flutter-vanillaDS](https://github.com/henriquenas/flutter-vanillaDS) (Ubuntu design system for Flutter) library
- You'll often find me exploring open source projects
- I'm good at a few other things, but I'm still figuring out what those are... ü§î

_If you need assistance, don't hesitate to call on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henriquenas-dev/). I'm here to help with anything that anyone may need._ ü§ù
